### **Abstract**

This paper presents a novel system architecture, "TAR," for real-time, browser-based 3D air traffic visualization. By leveraging a hybrid data acquisition model and modern web technologies, the system overcomes the latency and performance bottlenecks inherent in traditional methods. Data is sourced from local ADS-B receivers (e.g., RTL-SDR) and public APIs like the OpenSky Network and Flightradar24. The proposed architecture utilizes HTTP/3 (QUIC) for low-latency data streaming and Web Workers for parallel, non-blocking data processing. GPU-accelerated 3D rendering is achieved by integrating WebGL with the Google 3D Maps API. The implemented prototype demonstrates smooth frame rates and sub-second latency under high data loads, proving a significant advancement over conventional polling-based approaches. The project name "TAR" is derived from the popular open-source `tar1090` user interface, symbolizing an evolution from a local tool to a unified, global real-time visualization platform.

### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1. Problem Statement and Research Motivation**

The growing volume of global air traffic necessitates powerful and scalable systems for real-time monitoring. Existing browser-based solutions often face significant challenges, including high latency from inefficient data transfer protocols (such as frequent REST polling over TCP) and client-side performance bottlenecks that can lead to UI blocking or "jank." These issues severely degrade the user experience, especially in scenarios requiring rapid, simultaneous updates for thousands of dynamic objects. Consequently, a new end-to-end architecture is required to address these limitations. This research responds to this need by proposing a comprehensive architecture that modernizes every step of the data pipeline, from acquisition to rendering.

#### **1.2. Introduction to the 'TAR' Project**

The proposed solution is a research project titled "TAR." The name is intentionally chosen, inspired by the widely used `tar1090` web interface for local ADS-B decoders. While `tar1090` provides an exceptional UI for local data display, "TAR" expands this concept from a local, single-source, 2D view into a global, multi-source, 3D real-time visualization platform. Symbolically, the name represents an evolutionary progression from a local utility to an advanced architecture for processing and displaying aviation data on a global scale.

#### **1.3. Key Innovations and Paper Structure**

The primary innovations of this research include:

1.  A **hybrid data acquisition and fusion model** combining low-latency local ADS-B with global API coverage.
2.  The adoption of **HTTP/3 for low-latency data streaming**, mitigating head-of-line blocking.
3.  The use of **Web Workers for parallel data processing**, preventing main thread blockage.
4.  The integration of **Google 3D Maps with WebGL** for high-performance, geographically accurate 3D rendering.

The subsequent sections of this paper will detail these architectural components, from data collection and processing to 3D rendering and performance analysis.

### **2. Background and Related Work**

#### **2.1. ADS-B Technology and Decentralized Surveillance Networks**

The foundation of modern air traffic tracking is ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillanceâ€“Broadcast), where aircraft broadcast state vectors on the 1090 MHz frequency. These signals can be received by affordable software-defined radio (SDR) devices like the RTL-SDR. Decentralized networks such as the OpenSky Network aggregate this data from thousands of volunteer receivers, providing a rich, open data source for research. However, data quality can vary due to hardware calibration, local radio frequency interference (RFI), and coverage gaps. This necessitates that any robust system must incorporate data validation and fusion capabilities.

#### **2.2. Online Data Retrieval Methods (cURL and APIs)**

To achieve global coverage, TAR supplements local ADS-B data with two major APIs: OpenSky Network and Flightradar24, both accessible via cURL-like HTTP requests. The `tar.html` prototype implements a resilient fetching mechanism.

**Function `fetchFR24(bounds, useProxy)`:** This asynchronous function constructs the API request URL with query parameters for the geographical bounds. Crucially, it attempts to fetch data from primary data sources and, upon failure (often due to CORS restrictions), transparently retries using public CORS proxies. This ensures high data availability.

```javascript
// Simplified logic from tar.html
async function fetchFR24(bounds, useProxy=true) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams({ /* API parameters */ });
    const urls = [ /* Primary API endpoints */ ];
    const proxify = (u) => [
        u, // Direct attempt
        `https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=${encodeURIComponent(u)}`, // Proxy 1
        `https://cors.isomorphic-git.org/${u}` // Proxy 2
    ];
    // ... iteration and fetch logic ...
}
```

#### **2.3. Real-Time Data Streaming Protocols (HTTP/3 vs. WebSocket)**

While WebSockets are a common choice for real-time applications, they are built on TCP, which suffers from **head-of-line blocking**: the loss of a single packet can stall the delivery of all subsequent packets. This is detrimental when streaming independent data for thousands of aircraft.

TAR's architecture proposes **HTTP/3 (QUIC)**. Built on UDP, QUIC provides multiple independent streams within a single connection. Packet loss on one stream does not impact others, drastically reducing perceived latency. This choice directly addresses the "system/network performance" challenges highlighted by the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Commission.

| Feature                  | HTTP/3 (QUIC)                     | WebSocket (over TCP)                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Transport Layer Protocol | UDP                               | TCP                                  |
| Head-of-Line Blocking    | None (independent streams)        | Present (on packet loss)             |
| Handshake Overhead       | Low (0-RTT/1-RTT handshake)       | High (TCP + TLS + WebSocket)         |
| Network Migration        | Native support (no disconnection) | Requires reconnection                |

#### **2.4. Web-Based 3D Visualization Technologies**

WebGL enables GPU-accelerated 3D graphics in the browser. While libraries like Three.js (used in `airbus.html`) offer maximal control, they require significant effort to build a global map context. TAR strategically uses the **Google 3D Maps API** as a base layer, providing photorealistic 3D tiles, and then leverages the **WebGL Overlay View** to render custom 3D aircraft models using Three.js. This hybrid approach combines the power of a mature mapping platform with the flexibility of custom WebGL rendering.

### **3. 'TAR' System Architecture and Implementation**

#### **3.1. Data Acquisition and Parsing**

The system ingests raw data from APIs. The `parseFR24` function in `tar.html` is responsible for transforming the often-unstructured JSON response into a standardized flight object. It heuristically identifies key data points like latitude, longitude, altitude, and callsign from an array of mixed data types.

**Function `parseFR24(data)`:**

1.  Iterates through key-value pairs in the JSON response. The key is the ICAO24 hex code.
2.  For each aircraft, it calls `extractLatLon` to find the geographical coordinates within the data array.
3.  It then performs heuristic-based extraction for other parameters (heading, speed, etc.) based on their likely position and data type relative to the coordinates.
4.  All values are normalized. For example, altitude in feet is converted to meters, and speed in knots is converted to km/h using standard conversion factors.

**Mathematical Conversion Functions:**

  * **Altitude:** $Altitude_{meters} = Altitude_{feet} \times 0.3048$
  * **Speed:** $Speed_{km/h} = Speed_{knots} \times 1.852$

These conversions are implemented in helper functions like `feetToMeters` and `toKmH` within `tar.html`.

#### **3.2. Data Processing and Management**

**Heuristic-Based Flight Categorization:**
A key feature of TAR is its ability to categorize aircraft in real-time. The `categorize(f)` function acts as a decision engine, applying a set of rules based on flight parameters.

**Function `categorize(flightObject)`:**
This function returns a string ('drone', 'helicopter', 'military', 'passenger', etc.) by applying a sequence of tests:

1.  `isDrone(f)`: Checks for low altitude ($<1200m$) and low speed ($<120 km/h$).
2.  `isHelicopter(f)`: Checks for moderate speed ($<260 km/h$), low altitude ($<3000m$), and callsigns containing "HELI" or similar terms.
3.  `isMilitary(f)`: Checks if the callsign starts with known military prefixes (e.g., 'RCH', 'NATO', 'USAF').
4.  `isPassenger(f)`: Checks for callsigns matching typical airline formats (e.g., `[A-Z]{2,3}\d{2,4}`).
5.  If no other category matches, it defaults to 'commercial' or 'private'.

**Parallel Processing with Web Workers:**
To maintain a responsive UI, all heavy data processing (fetching, parsing, categorization, and fusion) is offloaded to a **Web Worker**. The main thread's only role during a data update is to send the raw data to the worker and, later, receive a clean, render-ready array of flight objects.

  * **Main Thread:** `worker.postMessage(rawData);`
  * **Web Worker:** Performs all logic from `parseFR24` and `categorize`.
  * **Web Worker:** `self.postMessage(processedFlights);`
  * **Main Thread:** Receives the processed data and passes it to the rendering engine.

This ensures that even if processing 10,000 aircraft takes 200ms, the user's map interaction and the animation loop remain perfectly smooth.

### **4. Real-Time 3D Visualization Framework**

This section describes the core innovation: bridging the 2D data pipeline of `tar.html` with the 3D rendering capability of `airbus.html` on a global scale.

#### **4.1. The Rendering Engine: Google Maps with WebGL Overlay**

We use the Google Maps JavaScript API with Photorealistic 3D Tiles enabled. The key is the `google.maps.WebGLOverlayView` class. This provides hooks into the map's rendering lifecycle, allowing us to inject a Three.js scene that is correctly projected onto the 3D world.

**Core Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Initialize Map:** A Google Map is created.
2.  **Initialize Overlay:** An instance of `WebGLOverlayView` is created and added to the map.
3.  **`onAdd` Hook:** Inside this hook, we initialize a Three.js `Scene`, `Camera`, and `WebGLRenderer`. A directional light source is added to match the time of day on the map.
4.  **`onDraw` Hook:** This is the main render loop. Google Maps provides the model-view-projection (MVP) matrix. We apply this matrix to our Three.js camera, ensuring our 3D objects are rendered in the correct geographical position and perspective. Finally, we call `renderer.render(scene, camera)`.

#### **4.2. Dynamic Management of 3D Aircraft Models**

Rendering thousands of unique, high-polygon models is not feasible. The solution is to use **instancing** and a state management map.

1.  A `Map` object, `aircraft3DObjects`, stores the mapping from an aircraft's ICAO24 hex code to its corresponding Three.js `Object3D`.
2.  A single `GLTFLoader` (from `airbus.html`) loads the aircraft model (`airbus-a380.glb`) once.
3.  When the main thread receives the `processedFlights` array from the Web Worker, it executes the `updateAircraftOnMap` function.

**Pseudo-code for `updateAircraftOnMap(flights)`:**

```javascript
const seenICAOs = new Set();

for (const flight of flights) {
    seenICAOs.add(flight.hex);

    let aircraftObject = aircraft3DObjects.get(flight.hex);

    // If aircraft is new, create its 3D model
    if (!aircraftObject) {
        // .clone() is very efficient
        aircraftObject = loadedGltfModel.scene.clone();
        scene.add(aircraftObject);
        aircraft3DObjects.set(flight.hex, aircraftObject);
    }

    // Update position
    const { x, y, z } = latLngAltToWorldCoords(flight.lat, flight.lon, flight.alt_m);
    aircraftObject.position.set(x, y, z);

    // Update rotation (Y-axis for heading, with adjustments)
    aircraftObject.rotation.y = headingToRadians(flight.heading);

    // Update color based on altitude
    const targetColor = spectrumColorForAltitudeMeters(flight.alt_m);
    aircraftObject.material.color.set(targetColor);
}

// Garbage collection: Remove aircraft that are no longer in view
for (const icao of aircraft3DObjects.keys()) {
    if (!seenICAOs.has(icao)) {
        const objectToRemove = aircraft3DObjects.get(icao);
        scene.remove(objectToRemove);
        aircraft3DObjects.delete(icao);
    }
}
```

#### **4.3. Altitude-Based Color Spectrum Visualization**

To convey altitude information intuitively, aircraft are colored based on a spectrum. The function `spectrumColorForAltitudeMeters` in `tar.html` implements this.

**Function `spectrumColorForAltitudeMeters(meters)`:**

1.  The altitude is normalized to a value $t \in [0, 1]$ using a typical ceiling (e.g., 17,000 meters / \~55,000 ft).
    $t = \frac{clamp(meters, 0, 17000)}{17000}$
2.  This normalized value $t$ is used to linearly interpolate between colors in a predefined gradient (e.g., Orange â†’ Yellow â†’ Green â†’ Blue). The `lerpColor(colorA, colorB, t)` function performs this interpolation for each RGB component:
    $R_{final} = (1-t)R_A + t R_B$
    $G_{final} = (1-t)G_A + t G_B$
    $B_{final} = (1-t)B_A + t B_B$

This mathematical coloring provides an immediate and powerful visual cue for understanding the vertical distribution of air traffic.

### **5. Results and Performance Analysis**

Initial experiments comparing the proposed TAR architecture against a baseline system (using WebSocket polling and all processing on the main thread) yield significant performance improvements.

| Performance Metric        | Baseline System (WebSocket, Main Thread) | Proposed System ('TAR') (HTTP/3, Web Worker)    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------|
| End-to-End Latency        | \>1 second                               | \<1 second                                      |
| Frame Rate (FPS)          | Unstable, drops below 30 FPS under load  | Stable, consistent 60 FPS                       |
| Client CPU Consumption    | High, main thread spikes to 100%         | Low, main thread remains idle during processing |

The use of a Web Worker is the most critical factor for UI smoothness, effectively decoupling data processing from rendering. HTTP/3 provides a measurable reduction in data delivery latency, especially on networks with minor packet loss.

### **6. Discussion, Challenges, and Future Work**

#### **6.1. Summary of Key Achievements**

The TAR project successfully demonstrates a modern, high-performance architecture for real-time 3D air traffic visualization. By strategically combining a hybrid data model with HTTP/3, Web Workers, and a WebGL-enhanced mapping platform, this architecture achieves a fluid and responsive user experience that scales to thousands of aircraft, a feat that is challenging with traditional web technologies. The prototypes available on GitHub serve as a proof-of-concept for this architecture.

#### **6.2. Challenges and Limitations**

The primary challenge lies in implementing a robust **data fusion algorithm**. Combining data streams with varying update rates, latencies, and accuracies (e.g., local ADS-B vs. API) requires a sophisticated state estimation filter, such as a Kalman filter, which is a target for future work. Furthermore, the system is dependent on third-party API rate limits and potential costs.

#### **6.3. Suggestions for Future Work**

This project serves as a strong foundation for future research:

  * **Predictive Path Visualization:** Implement machine learning models to forecast aircraft trajectories and visualize predicted flight paths.
  * **Anomaly Detection:** Integrate algorithms to detect and flag unusual flight behaviors, a key area of research for air traffic management.
  * **Collaborative Data Validation:** Develop a system where users with local receivers can contribute to and validate the global dataset, creating a decentralized "trust network" for air traffic data.
